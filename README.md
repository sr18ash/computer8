        <p>To our dearest adviser,</p>
        <p>As the school year comes to a close, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your guidance and support throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Your expertise in math has not only helped me excel in the subject, but also instilled in me a deeper understanding and appreciation for it.</p>
        <p>Your role as my adviser has also been invaluable, providing me with wisdom and encouragement whenever I needed it and understanding the reason why I sometimes pass activities late for the past quarter which is because of BulPriSA.</p>
        <p>Thank you for believing in us and cheering us up when we lost at intramurals.</p>
        <p>I am grateful to have you as my teacher and adviser.</p>
        <p>SINCERELY,</p>
        <p>Rhianna Ashley S. Reyes</p>
